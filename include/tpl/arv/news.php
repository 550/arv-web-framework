<div style="margin-top:35px;margin-left:22px;font-size:18px;color:#547da1;">What is the ARV framework?</div>
<div style="margin-left:33px;">The ARV web framework is a client and server side tool that simplify the coding technique to load asynchronous content into pages. In the most simple case, a programmer would have only one line of code to insert inside HTML anchor tags. 
<br><br>
<div style="margin-left:14px;">Code example : <em><span style="color:#54a15f">&lt;a</span> <span style="color:#a19454">&lt;?php</span>=siteTools::generateAnchorAttributes(<span style="color:#547da1">array</span>(<span style="color:#a1545c">'attributes'</span> =&gt; <span style="color:#547da1">array</span>(<span style="color:#a1545c">'href'</span> =&gt; <span style="color:#a1545c">'page=click&urlvar=value'</span>))<span style="color:#a19454">?&gt;</span><span style="color:#54a15f">&gt;</span>Click<span style="color:#54a15f">&lt;/a&gt;</span></em></div>
<br>
The main goal of the ARV framework is to increase the navigation speed for any heavy content website that also has a lot of graphic element. Also, the framework does that while remaining compatible with other JavaScript frameworks and compatible as well with a MVC architecture on the server side.

<div style="margin-top:35px;margin-left:22px;font-size:18px;color:#547da1;">What are the main features of the framework?</div>
<div style="margin-left:33px;">
<div style="margin-left:2px;list-style-type:square;">
<li>Even if the user has JavaScript turned off, the system will continue to link and render all the requests exactly as they are meant to.</li>
<br>
<li>Everything is transparent to the user, more clearly it means that nothing is different about any browsing comportement the user is used with. Which include surfing history (back and forward), URL sharing and page refreshing.</li>
<br>
<li>Surfing is faster, much faster. Which leads to a greater number of clicks during a time restrained browsing session.</li>
<br>
<li>And the latest feature is that it is very easy and fast to work with the ARV framework. So easy that a web developer can use it even if he only knows structure languages like HTML.</li>
