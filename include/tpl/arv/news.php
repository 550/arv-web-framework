<div style="margin-top:35px;margin-left:22px;font-size:18px;color:#547da1;">What is the ARV framework?</div>
<div style="margin-left:33px;">The ARV web framework is a client and server side code that simplify the way how developers have to program to load asynchronous content into pages. In the most simple case, a programmer only have one server side line of code to insert inside of a HTML anchor tag. Example :
<br><br>
<div style="margin-left:14px;"><em><span style="color:#54a15f">&lt;a</span> &lt;?=siteTools::generateAnchorAttributes(<span style="color:#547da1">array</span>(<span style="color:#a1545c">'attributes'</span> =&gt; <span style="color:#547da1">array</span>(<span style="color:#a1545c">'href'</span> =&gt; <span style="color:#a1545c">'page=click&urlvar=value'</span>))?&gt;<span style="color:#54a15f">&gt;</span>Click<span style="color:#54a15f">&lt;/a&gt;</span></em></div>

<br>
<li>Everything is transparent to the user, more clearly it means that nothing is different about any browsing comportement he is used with. Which are the surfing history (back and forward), URL sharing and page refreshing.</li>
<br>
<li>Surfing is faster, much faster. That leads to a greater number of clicks per users during a time restrained browsing session.</li>
<br>
<li>And the latest feature is that it is very easy to work with the ARV framework. So easy that a web developer can use it even if he only knows structure languages like HTML.</li>
